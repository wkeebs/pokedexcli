# Pokedex CLI

This is a simple cli application I wrote in Go to interact with the Pokemon API!

A user can use:

- `map` and `mapb`: Display map locations (and information about them!)
- `catch <pokemon-name>`: Catch a Pokemon (or try to...)
- `inspect <pokemon-name>`: Inspect a Pokemon to find out more about them.
- `pokedex` Track caught Pokemon
