# Pokedex CLI

This is a simple cli application I wrote in Go to interact with the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon)!

The available commands are:

- `help` : Displays a help message
- `quit` : Exit the Pokedex
- `map` : Displays 20 location areas (i.e., next page)
- `mapb` : Displays the previous 20 locations (i.e., prev page)
- `explore` : Lists all Pokemon in a given area.
- `catch <pokemon-name>` : Attempts to catch a Pokemon.
- `inspect <pokemon-name>`: Inspect a Pokemon's stats.
- `pokedex <pokemon-name>`: Lists all of the Pokemon you have caught.
